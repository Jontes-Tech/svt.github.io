We are very good consumers of Open Source software at SVT. We use a large number of frameworks and products - however we could and should be better at contributing back and optimize our own usage.

Therefore the technical board took the decision that:

*We (SVT) should strive to work with open source*  
*There will be a virtual team, actively working with the first decision*

We believe that we can benefit from an Open Source strategy in many ways:

*Better quality of our code (by patching and contributing back to external projects we use)*  
*Better knowledge of the software we base our products on and that SVT's fundamental mission is dependent on*  
*PR (both general and for recruiting), respect and more recognition for SVTi as a modern and open tech company that is giving back to s    ociety in alignment with its public service mission*  
*Developer satisfaction and even more engagement*
