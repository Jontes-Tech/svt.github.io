# SVT OPEN SOURCE/CONTENT SITE

This is the project for SVT's Open Source/Content site, built with GitHub Pages and Hugo.

While the added code and assets for this project is _browsable_ in this repo, for a learning experience, they are *not* under an general Open license, due to: 

a) mostly being small additions to CSS and minor text paragraphs.  
b) or being assets not allowed or intended to release for free usage, like for example the typography, logos or images which SVT does not have the right to release further under a more liberal licensing.

### Brand Icons

All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners.
These trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder, nor vice versa.

## Typography

SVT uses the font family Publik to maintain a consistent visual style. Publik is designed exclusively for SVT, for legibility in digital channels, broadcast and print.

We have taken great care to make it as credible and functional as possible for hard news and engaging copy alike.

It is our ambition that our font family will help our users and viewers connect our content to the SVT brand. For this reason, Publik is not available for non-SVT use.

## Logo

The SVT logotype carries SVT's brand identity. It can only be used with our explicit permission.
