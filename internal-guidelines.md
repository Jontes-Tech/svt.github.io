# Purpose (Why?)

We are very good at using Open Source software at SVT. We use a large number of frameworks and products - however we can be better at contributing back and optimize our usage.

Therefore the technical board took the decision that:

    We should strive to work with open source
    There will be a virtual team, actively working with the first decision

We believe that we can benefit from a Open Source strategy in many ways:

    Better quality of our code (by patching and contributing back to external projects we use)
    Better knowledge of the software we base our products on and that SVT's fundamental mission is dependent on
    PR (both general and for recruiting), respect and more recognition for SVTi as a modern and open tech company that is giving back to society in alignment with its public service mission
    Developer satisfaction and even more engagement
    ...

# Focus areas (What?)

We can identify four areas were SVT could do a lot better regarding open source.
For SVT's part specifically, we are focusing on 1) and 2) and 3):

    Contribute
    Publish
    Correct usage of
    Requisition and comparisons when buying new product
