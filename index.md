Sveriges Television, The Swedish national public TV broadcaster, builds its services with mainly open source products. We also contribute to the Open Source community, by bug fixing or by releasing projects that we think could benefit others.

## Contributing to SVT's Open Source Projects

Contributing to an SVT-project is easy and follows the regular GitHub flow. Fork the repository and follow the code guidelines and best practices for that project. Make your changes and send a pull request on Github!
