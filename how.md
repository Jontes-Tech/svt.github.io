# Guidelines

## Copyright

Everything we code under working hours is, just like expected, copyright SVT.

## Identity

There must be a clear distinction between the identities one use if you contribute to a project as a private individual or as a SVT-employee

Therefore we use our SVT-identity when commiting - in other words, commit with a name@svt.se address.

The GitHub account that we use for commiting to an SVT project must have an real name in the name settings.

## Licenses 

Use an [OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).

An [GPL or MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/) should be good for most cases.

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) is good for non code like text and graphics.

## Maintenance

The product teams are autonomous and is responsible for maintenance.

If a project is not active any more, it should be clear in the project README-file.

## Contributing to open source projects

One does not need permission to contribute to an existing open source project. However, when an organization CLA is required, contact your open source leads.

Make sure the contribution is quality checked by a colleague before pushing to an public repo.

## Starting a new open source project

Before submitting a new open source project, make sure your team and product owner is all onboard.

Check with your open source leads.

## Source code repositories

We publish our open source projects at SVT's github. 

The GitHub-presentation page is https://svt.github.io/
