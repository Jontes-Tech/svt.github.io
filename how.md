Our internal guidlines are ever changing, but basically they looks like this.

# Focus areas

We can identify four areas were SVT could do a lot better regarding open source.

1. Contribute
2. Publish
3. Correct usage of
4. Requisition and comparisons when buying a new product

# Virtual team

A virtual team intend to have regular meetings once every other month, or when needed.

The current purpose of the group is to:

*Support the teams and individuals in working with open source*  
*Work out guidelines*  
*Oversight of the health of public projects from SVT*  
*Keep contact with others, internal and externa*  
*Other activities - blog, speakers, hackday etc.*  
*Contribution culture*  

# Guidelines

## Copyright

Everything we code under working hours is, just like expected, copyright SVT.

## Identity

There must be a clear distinction between the identities one use if you contribute to a project as a private individual or as a SVT-employee

Therefore we use our SVT-identity when commiting - in other words, commit with a name@svt.se address.

The GitHub account that we use for commiting to an SVT project must have an real name in the name settings.

## Licenses 

* Use an [OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).

* An [GPL or MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/) should be good for most cases.

* [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) for non code like text and graphics.

## Maintenance

The product teams are autonomous and is responsible for maintenance.

If a project is not active any more, it should be clear in the project README-file.

The README-file must have at least one SVT employee listed as a contact person if it is an active project.

## Contributing to open source projects

One does not need permission to contribute to an existing open source project. However, when an organization CLA is required, contact your open source leads.

Make sure the contribution is quality checked by a colleague before pushing to an public repo.

## Starting a new open source project

Before submitting a new open source project, make sure your team and product owner is all onboard.

Check with your open source leads.

## Code-Of-Conduct

We think the Greek fabulist Aesop, c. 620 â€“ 564 BCE, nailed it pretty good.
*No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.*

## Links, Source code repositories

* We publish our open source projects at SVT's official github page
* The GitHub-presentation page is https://www.svt.se/opensource/
* There is an official template for new projects at https://github.com/SVT/open-source-project-template
* We have release account at bintray jcenter https://bintray.com/svt/opensource

## F.A.Q

* Are there any licenses we shouldn't use in our work today?
  
  See the text about licenses.

* How do I get the time to work on project X?
 
  An open source project is as active and takes as much  or as little time as one wants it too.  Use our regular processes and workflows and timebox for adding features, in your regular project planning, or on other occasions like hackfridays. The only obligation we have is to be clear that if we host an open source project that is NOT taking bugfixes and so on, it should be stated clearly in the README.

* What process and workflows we should we use?
  
  It is up to the teams, just work as you do now.

* What tech stack should we use?
  
  Use the tech your team members are used to, and prefer tech that is in common use at SVT. We don't release bigger projects for which there are only a few people skilled in the tech used.
We publish our open source projects at SVT's github.
